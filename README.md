# startup-files
This repository was created after my last computer died unexpectedly (rip). I hope this can be of help in setting up a new computer if my current one were to die, too.

## Contents

### Bash + Vim
I use a few different profiles and configs for both Bash and Vim, either for updating my shell prompt or setting Vim's syntax to on by default.

### VS Code
VS Code is my code editor of choice, so I have a few different settings I use by default, such as setting tab size to 2.

I also have a pretty well set list of extensions (you can get your own list using the `code --list-extensions` command) to make development easier and faster.

## Installation
To install all of the settings and files, run the following command from the root repo directory:

```console
$ ./install.sh
```

Yeah, it's that easy.
