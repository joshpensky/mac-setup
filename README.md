# startup-files
This repository was created after my last computer died unexpectedly (rip). Hoping this can help set up a new computer faster if my next one were to die too.


## Bash + Vim
There are a few different profiles I use for Bash and Vim. These can be found in the `bash + vim` folder.

These files should be added to the user's root directory: `~`.


## VS Code
These are the different settings and extensions I use for my code editor of choice, Visual Studio code. These can be found in the `vscode` folder.

### Settings
These settings file should be added to the following directory: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User`.

### Extensions
To install the extensions, make sure to have the VS Code command line tools installed, then run the following commands:
```bash
$ chmod u+x ./vscode/install-extensions.sh
$ ./vscode/install-extensions.sh
```
